    <h1>website as a paper airplane</h1>
    <p>a website is like a paper airplane. Just as a paper airplane 
        can come in various shapes and designs, a website can be 
        creatively designed to stand out and capture attention. Both 
        require thoughtful design elements to be effective. A well-folded 
        paper airplane flies smoothly through the air, much like a well-designed 
        website should provide smooth navigation for users. Just as a paper airplane's 
        folds determine its flight path, a website's layout and structure determine 
        how users navigate through its content.</p>
