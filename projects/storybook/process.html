        <p style="position: relative;left:30px;top:40px; 
        font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">For this project, I was inspired by my cat to
        tell a story about the life <br>of a simple house cat. For many cats, their most favourite 
        activity is <br>to eat, so I figured I would create a visual narrative of that.<br>
        I was inspired by the example of Tess Smith Roberts' side by side <br>frame style. 
        I wanted to have the colourful shapes in the background <br>to be clickable for the user to
        reveal the next frame if they click the <br>correct shape. Unfortunately I couldn't get this
        to work, so I improvised <br>and incorporated the interactive function in the captions of the frames.</p>

        font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I encountered a couple obstacles and had to change my drawings a bit. 
        I was having trouble figuring <br>out how to create curved lines. I managed to find an example online, but the mouth didn't 
        turn out as <br>curved as I wanted to.
